# Part 1

### Instructions

The previous developer went AWOL. It is your job to come in and save the day. The app should meet all of the following criteria.

* Map should be ~40% height of screen (regardless of screen size)
* Map should show users current location (blue circle)
* Map should zoom in to the users current location
* Foursquare should fetch places near the users current location
* Red pins should appear for each Foursquare venue
* Table view should show 1 row for each Foursquare venue

**BEFORE YOU START**

Look over the code. Look over all of the code. Most of the requirements are either partially implemented, or there's a bug that you need to identify and fix. **Do not** just start building things. Identify a requirement, find all areas in the code that would affect that requirement, solve the problem, repeat.
